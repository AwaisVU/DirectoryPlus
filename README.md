This a React JS based CRUD app to manage contacts, including an API call which populates random users in formatted way.
I am happy to share the codebase to learners, who want to visualize React's modern structure and how the complete front-end components are aligned.
I haven't used a database for this small app, whilst hard coded the models within frontend.
